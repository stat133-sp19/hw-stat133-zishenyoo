This assignment focuses on working with a more complex file structure, practicing with github, and visulizing shot data of NBA players. More especifically, I produced a “shot
charts” for a handful of players from the Golden State Warriors, as well as other summaries
and visualizations. This assignment also requires us to produce
a summarizing report document to summarize our findings.
