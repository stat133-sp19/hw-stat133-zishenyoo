A famous quote by Brendol Hux:

  "During the Clone Wars, I served in the Grand Army of the Republic. I was a junior officer who communicated tactics and strategy as determined by our Jedi generals."

###2.Cooking Recipe: Baked Bufflo Wings

####Ingredients
* 1 to 4 pounds chicken wings that have been cut into flats and drumettes
* 1 1/2 teaspoons to 2 tablespoons baking powder (using 1 1/2 teaspoons per pound)
* 1 to 4 teaspoons kosher salt (using 1 teaspoon per pound; use less salt if you’re not using Diamond brand)
* 2 tablespoons hot sauce (Frank’s RedHot is traditional) per pound of wings
* 1 1/2 to 2 tablespoons unsalted butter per pound of wings

####Special Kitchen Tools
* Oven-safe cooling rack
* Oven
* Large Baking Sheet with foil

####Steps of the Recipe
1. Pat wings dry with a paper towel, and then, in a large bowl, toss them with 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder and 1 teaspoon kosher salt per pound of wings, until thoroughly coated. Arrange them on the rack with some space between them (the surface will not dry and crisp as well where they touch) and place in your refrigerator uncovered for 8 to 24 hours.
2. When you’re ready to bake them, heat your oven to 450 degrees, with a rack set in the top half of your oven. Bake your wings for 20 minutes, flip them with tongs or a spatula, bake them for another 15 minutes, flip them back over again, and then for 15 final minutes, for a total roasting time of 50 minutes. You might need up to 5 minutes longer for larger wings. Wings are done with they are browned and crisp.
3. While the wings roast, make Buffalo wing sauce. In a medium saucepan, for each pound of wings, combine 2 tablespoons of hot sauce and 1 1/2 tablespoons (for a hotter sauce) to 2 tablespoons (for a mild, more buttery sauce) unsalted butter over medium heat until melted, whisking to combine. Set aside. Make Blue Cheese Dressing, if you wish (recipe below) and prepare carrots and celery.
4.When wings are done, roll each in prepared Buffalo wing sauce. Serve with fixings of your choice. Eat immediately.

#### When Should We Eat the Wings?
Usually in America, people eat wings especially bufflo wings during the super bowl season. However, you can also eat it when you watch other fun games in home.

####Variations of the recipe
If you don't like the bufflo sauce, you can make the sticky sesame version of wings. At the third steps, instead of dipping wings into bufflo sauce, you can stir wings together with garlic, salt, soy, hoisin, honey, sesame oil and cayenne or Sriracha until coated.

###3. Euclidean Distance

###Definition
***
The **Euclidean distance** between points \mathbf{p} and \mathbf{q} is the length of the line segment connecting them **\(\overline{pq}\)**.

In Cartesian coordinates, if \mathbf{p} = (*$p_{1}$*,*$p_{2}$*,...,*$p_{n}$*) and \mathbf{q} = (*$q_{1}$*,*$q_{2}$*,...,*$q_{n}$*) are two points in Euclidean n-space, then the distance (d) from \mathbf{p} to \mathbf{q}, or from \mathbf{q} to \mathbf{p} is given by the Pythagorean formula:

\begin{align}d(\mathbf{p},\mathbf{q}) = d(\mathbf{q},\mathbf{p}) & = \sqrt{(q_1-p_1)^2 + (q_2-p_2)^2 + \cdots + (q_n-p_n)^2} \\
& = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n (q_i-p_i)^2}.\tag{1} \end{align}

The positon of a point in a Euclidean n-space is a Euclidean vector.So, \mathbf{p} and \mathbf{q} may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space(initial point) with their tips(terminal points) ending at the two points. The Euclidean norm, or Euclidean length, or magnitude of a vector measures the length of the vector.

\begin{equation}
\lVert \mathbf{P} \rVert = \sqrt{p_1^2 +p_2^2 + \cdots +p_n^2} = \sqrt{P \cdot P},
\end{equation}
where the last expression involves the dot product.
